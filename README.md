# CrossChurnA
CrossChurnAI combines customer churn analysis across industries like banking and telecom to develop a generalized churn prediction model. Leveraging Machine Learning, Gen AI, and Embeddings, this project identifies at-risk customers, provides AI-powered explanations, and finds patterns across industries. 
# 🚀 CrossChurnAI - AI-Powered Multi-Industry Churn Prediction  

CrossChurnAI is a **Machine Learning & Gen AI**-based project designed to predict customer churn across industries like **banking and telecom**. Unlike traditional models focused on a single industry, CrossChurnAI leverages **transfer learning & embeddings** to detect **cross-industry churn patterns** and provide AI-powered insights into customer behavior.  

## 🔥 Key Features  
- ✅ **Multi-Industry Churn Model** – Predict churn for telecom and banking customers using a unified approach.  
- ✅ **Gen AI Assistant** – AI-powered explanations for churn predictions using LLMs.  
- ✅ **Customer Pattern Matching** – Embeddings to identify similar customer behaviors across industries.  
- ✅ **Explainability** – Understand *why* a customer is likely to churn.  

## 📌 Dataset  
We use two datasets:  
1️⃣ **Telecom Churn Dataset** (Customer call behavior, tenure, plan usage)  
2️⃣ **Banking Churn Dataset** (Transaction history, customer complaints, balance trends)  

📌 **Merging Strategy:**  
- Exploring **common features** (e.g., tenure, spending behavior, service complaints)  
- Using **embeddings** to create cross-industry behavioral similarity  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, PyTorch/TensorFlow)  
- **Gen AI** (LLMs like GPT for explanations)  
- **Embeddings** (Vector search to find similar customers)  
- **ML Deployment** (Flask/Streamlit for UI)  

## 🚀 How to Run  
1️⃣ Clone the repository:  
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CrossChurnAI.git
